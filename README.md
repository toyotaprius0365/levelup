A simple discord bot that tracks the users level, xp and user ID and username, which it then stores in a data.json file in the same directory
No special installation requirements, it will automatically create roles in your server upon launch (although with random colouors, you may want to change this).

Created with Python 3.8, so that or anything above it should be enough to run this file.

:D
