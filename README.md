# Level UP!

A simple discord bot that tracks the users level, xp and user ID and username, which it then stores in a data.json file in the same directory

**Permissions Required:**
- applications.commands
- bot.administrator (alternatively, send messages, read message history, view channels and manage roles)

Created with Python 3.8, so that or anything above it should be enough to run this file.

:D
